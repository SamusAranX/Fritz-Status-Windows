## Known issues
* Sometimes, after having Fritz!Status minimized for a while, the window’s size may be off. [This is Microsoft’s fault](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/616008/wpf-sizing-is-broken-if-window-is-minimized) and I refuse to work around their 5+ year old bug.
* Password protection is still not supported.
